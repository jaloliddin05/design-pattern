Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other. 
These patterns define the ways in which objects collaborate and compose to achieve specific behavioral goals. Behavioral design patterns deal 
with responsibilities and algorithms of objects, emphasizing communication between them.

Here are some common behavioral design patterns:

1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:**
   - Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

2. **Command Pattern:**
   - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and support for 
   undoable operations.

3. **Interpreter Pattern:**
   - Defines a grammar for interpreting the sentences in a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences of the language.

4. **Iterator Pattern:**
   - Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

5. **Mediator Pattern:**
   - Defines an object that centralizes communication between other objects, promoting loose coupling and avoiding direct interactions between components.

6. **Memento Pattern:**
   - Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without exposing its internal structure.

7. **Observer Pattern:**
   - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

8. **State Pattern:**
   - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

9. **Strategy Pattern:**
   - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from 
   clients that use it.

10. **Template Method Pattern:**
    - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

11. **Visitor Pattern:**
    - Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes 
    of the elements on which it operates.

Behavioral design patterns help in managing and organizing the responsibilities and behaviors of objects in a system, making it more flexible, modular, 
and easier to maintain. They address the ways objects collaborate, communicate, and distribute responsibilities to achieve specific behavioral goals.
